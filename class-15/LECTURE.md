* What constructor do we need.
* What behaviors are does our application to be a minimal viable product.
  * 2 - 5 features / behaviors.
  * try to thinkg of these from the users perspective.
* Not a huge focus on code writing.
  * Wireframes for your UI.
Tuesday / Wednesday: Focus on implementation and iteration:

* What things are we implementing
